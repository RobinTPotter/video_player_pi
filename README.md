# video_player_pi

this is a flask webserver designed specifically to list the contents of folders listed in the config.py.
the contents are shown as bootstrap buttons on a website accessed at the port defined in ./runme
pressing a button takes you to a new page with some of the keyboard commands for omxplayer, by pressing the button you also start omxplayer with your selection.

clone the repo, cd into it and chmod +x runme
the default port is 12345
runme generates a stopme file if you run runme nohupped or experience some difficulty killing the app and closing the port.

its cheap and cheerfull and was written almost exclusively on a phone using connectbot.
its my first flask web app and was made for my wife. xx
